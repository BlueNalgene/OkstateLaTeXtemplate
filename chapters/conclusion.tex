I hope this helps someone.  

Lots of the code was stolen with love from the UArk template.  Which, in turn, was stolen with love from UCSD.  I left comments which acted as signatures inside the .cls file to show some love to the original code authors and editors.  Please feel free to show me love when you steal this code for yourself.  This code is available for free, but feel free to buy me a beer some time.
