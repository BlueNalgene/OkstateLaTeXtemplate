Welcome to the \LaTeX template for your dissertation at Oklahoma State University.  The words in here will show off some of the things built in to the template.

\section{An Introduction to Introductions}

There are lots of things you can do with this template.  I'm sure you have spent too much time slaving away over your research, so the WYSIWYW interface will help you focus on the content of your dissertation.

\subsection{Citing Sources}

The citations for this template are stored in the ``thesis.bib'' file.  The bibliography format in the ``\#rootDissertation.tex'' file is set to organize things by when they show up in the paper.  Here is a paper I cited in my dissertation~\cite{arrhenius_xxxi._1896}.

The current setup places all of your references at the end of the dissertation.  If you want to include a list of references at the end of each chapter, you should make a new ``*.bib'' file for each chapter and tell \LaTeX to insert it at the end of the chapter files.
