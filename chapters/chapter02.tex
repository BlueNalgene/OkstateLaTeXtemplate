\section{Adding Tables}
	
This is where your first chapter goes.  I sure like using \LaTeX, don't you?  Let's add in a table (see Table~\ref{tab:table1}).
	
	\begin{table}[!ht]
		\caption{A Table to Try.}
		\label{tab:table1}
		\small
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{c | c | c}
			Spam   & Eggs  & Toast    \\ \hline
			3000   & 3000  & A \\
			100    & 100   & B \\
			0      & 20    & C
		\end{tabular} 
	\end{table}
	
That's pretty neat.  If you look in the code, you will see that I have used the ``!ht'' option for tables and figures.  This is generally what you want to use for the dissertation.
