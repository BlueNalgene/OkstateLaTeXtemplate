\section{Adding Figures}

Time for the second chapter.  It is simple to add figures to this template.  Check out Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}.  If you look closely at the caption beneath the figure and the caption in the List of Figures, you can see that they are different.  This is because I have found that large captions are useful to describe what you might be seeing in the figure, but they could clutter up the main list.  

	
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{lion.png}
		\caption[SHORT LABEL]{A picture of a very handsome lion}
		\label{fig:figure1}
	\end{figure}
