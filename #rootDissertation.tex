%% Author's personal definitions go here
\newcommand{\angstrom}{\textup{ \AA}} % siunitx doesn't support angstroms
\newcommand{\degree}{$^{\circ}$} % I used this in my old tables, possibly can be replaced by siunitx options, but I'm too lazy to deal with that right now.


%%% This is required formatting for OSU dissertations.  Do not touch.
%Settings for the Chapter Titles

% We use the top margin to make the correct size spacing for new chapters
% According to the OKSTATE style, the chapter number should be 2 inches from the
% top of the page.  Since I haven't figured out how to do math inside of size 
% options such as \vspace, I need to do this manually.  
% 2 in = 6.0225pc
%Requires titlesec package
\titleformat{\chapter}[display]
	{\normalfont\filcenter}
	{\vspace{0pc}% %This should be 2in, but it this works with the class.
